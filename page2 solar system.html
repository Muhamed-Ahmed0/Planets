<h1>The solar system</h1>
<p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.</p>
<br>
<p>Since we now know about the solar system lets learn about the planets of the solar system:</p>

<h1>The planets of our solar system</h1>


<h4>Mercury</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury/overview/">"Mercury"</a> also known as <strong>a dead planet</strong> beacuse it does'nt support life it is also the smallest planet in our solar system, Althought Mercury is the nearest planet to our sun but it's not the hottest planet,Venus is hotter, It is also a <strong>rocky planet</strong>  </p>
<h4>Venus</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/">"Venus"</a>, second planet from the Sun and sixth in the solar system in size and mass. No planet approaches closer to Earth than Venus; at its nearest it is the closest large body to Earth other than the Moon. Because Venus’s orbit is nearer the Sun than Earth’s, the planet is always roughly in the same direction in the sky as the Sun and can be seen only in the hours near sunrise or sunset. When it is visible, it is the most brilliant planet in the sky.</p>    
<h4>Earth(our planet)</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/">"Earth"</a> is our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things, While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal, Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic.</p>

<h4>Mars</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/">"Mars"</a> is also referred to as the “Red Planet” because it has high content of iron oxide which makes it appear reddish, Mars has a thin atmosphere, Mars has only two moons as compared to Uranus’ twenty-seven. They are named: Phobos and Deimos. These moons are small and are irregularly shaped, It is not quite a "dead planet" like mercury, Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. </p>

<h4>Jupiter</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/">"Jupiter"</a> has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe, Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

    Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>
 
    <h4>Saturn</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/">"Saturn"</a> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system, Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.
    Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>
   
    <h4>Uranus</h4>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/uranus/overview/">"Uranus"</a> is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star, It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus.</p>

<h4>Neptune</h4>

<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/overview/">"Neptune"</a> is dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system, More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.

    NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.</p>
     
<h4>Pluto</h4>

<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto/overview/">"Pluto"</a> – which is smaller than Earth’s Moon – has a heart-shaped glacier that’s the size of Texas and Oklahoma. This fascinating world has blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows – but the snow is red.

    On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight through the Pluto system – providing the first close-up images of Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that has transformed our understanding of these mysterious worlds on the solar system’s outer frontier, The reason behind Pluto’s classification to dwarf planet was because it did not meet the criteria for being a planet, which was defined by the International Astronomical Union. These were it must orbit the Sun, In other words <strong>pluto is not a planet</strong></p>
